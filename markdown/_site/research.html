<h4 id="university-of-wisconsin-madison--aug-2023---present">University of Wisconsin Madison | Aug. 2023 - Present</h4>
<p>Under <a href="https://shivaram.org/" target="_blank">Professor Shivaram Venkataraman</a>, I am performing research which addresses the need for accurate battery state-of-charge (SoC) and state-of-health (SoH) predictions in energy storage systems. We explore SoC prediction in batteries with diverse fast charging policies, resembling real-world scenarios. Key findings include the identification of crucial training features, successful adaptation to unforeseen charging policies using continuous learning, and efficient transition from SoC to SoH prediction without additional development.</p>

<p>Bayesian optimization (BO) is an inherently sequential workflow that cannot fully utilize modern supercomputers’ parallel architecture. Overseen by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aperezdieguez/?originalSubdomain=es" target="_blank">Professor Adrián Pérez Diéguez</a>, I designed two <a href="https://github.com/gptune/GPTune" target="_blank">GPTune-RCI</a> implementations which enable parallel function evaluation during BO. My parallel BO implementations reduced search time by up to 84% for prominent HPC applications. Further testing also demonstrated up to 77% reduced search time relative to the state-the-art HPC tuner (DeepHyper) which also employs parallelism. Additionally, I implemented a novel parallel multitask learning algorithm which improves both time-to-optimal-solution and final solution quality.</p>

<p>Overseen by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mC3JPI8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Professor Brian Haab</a>, I built a large scale image processing toolkit for biological sliding window analysis. By combining the integral image method with GPU programming, I achieved a speedup of 131,806x on small-scale images and a speedup of 10,901x on large-scale microscopy images compared to the previously used method. Our toolkit is publicly available through the <a href="https://github.com/OckermanSethGVSU/Bio-PII" target="_blank">BioPII</a> PIP package. Our work was recently accepted as a short paper in <a href="https://cmte.ieee.org/cis-bbtc/wp-content/uploads/sites/172/IEEE_CIBCB_2023_paper_2015.pdf" target="_blank">IEEE CIBCB 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Mentored by <a href="https://cse.osu.edu/people/stewart.962" target="_blank">Professor Christopher Stewart</a>, I worked to examine the current neural network benchmarking practices in digital agriculture. I empirically demonstrated the dangers of using classical datasets for digital agriculture neural network benchmarking. Additionally, I designed a GBM which could predict final neural network test set performance  with 87% accuracy using only 3% of the training time required for convergence. I led a team of three in the writing of an <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03315" target="_blank">arXiv paper</a>, and later I built my work into a full paper which was accepted for publication at <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=vBSUoUuAYOA" target="_blank">AAAI 2023</a>.</p>
