My research typically involves applications of ML, HPC, and Systems. I've enjoyed being able to work on a variety of different projects in diverse domains.

## Improving the Scalability of Large Scale Image Processing through HPC
Overseen by [Professor Brian Haab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mC3JPI8AAAAJ&hl=en), I built a large scale image processing toolkit for biological sliding window analysis. By combining the integral image method with GPU programming, I achieved a speedup of 131,806x on small-scale images and a speedup of TODO on large-scale microscopy images compared to the previously used method. Our toolkit is publicly available through the [Bio_PII](https://github.com/OckermanSethGVSU/Bio-PII) PIP package. Our work is currently in submission for IEEE CIBCB 2023.

## Predicting COVID-19 Cases Using Twitter Image Data
Mentored by [Professor Erin Carrier](https://eecarrier.github.io/), I created a project that helped to improve our COVID response through more accurate COVID-19 case count prediction. My work was published in [IEEE ICMLA 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10068950) where I recently presented it.


## Improving AI Model Selection in the Domain of Digital Agriculture
Mentored by [Professor Christopher Stewart](https://cse.osu.edu/people/stewart.962), I worked to examine the current neural network benchmarking practices in digital agriculture. I empirically demonstrated the dangers of using classical datasets for digital agriculture neural network benchmarking. Additionally, I designed a GBM which could predict final neural network test set performance  with 87% accuracy using only 3% of the training time required for convergence. I led a team of three in the writing of an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03315), and later I built my work out into a [full paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vBSUoUuAYOA) which was accepted for publication at AAAI 2023. 

## Improving the Accessibility of Video Games
My freshmen year, I worked as a research assistant for Professor Ira Woodring. I helped perform literature review, summarized and aggregated useful sources, and contributed towards a GameBoy Emulator in C.
