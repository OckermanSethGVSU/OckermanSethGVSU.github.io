### Online Finetuning of ML models in Energy Constrained Environments  
#### University of Wisconsin Madison - Aug. 2023 - Present
I am exploring different methods of training and finetuning ML models for predicting battery state-of-charge in energy constrained environments. Additionally, I am investigating each method's impact on overall energy usage.

### Multi-Model and Multi-Seed Parallel Multi-Task BO 
#### University of California Berkeley | Aug. 2023 - Present
I implemented Multi-Model and Multi-Seed Parallel Multi-Task BO into the UC-Berkeley [GPTune](https://github.com/gptune/GPTune){:target="_blank"} codebase. Early results show improved-time-to-solution and final parameter selection. I am currently exploring other parallel multi-task BO implementations for GPTune.

### Harnessing Parallelization for Bayesian Optimization HPC Tuning Searches 
#### Lawrence Berkeley Lab | June 2023 - Present
Bayesian optimization (BO) is an inherently sequential workflow that cannot fully utilize modern supercomputers' parallel architecture. Overseen by [Professor Adrián Pérez Diéguez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aperezdieguez/?originalSubdomain=es){:target="_blank"}, I designed two [GPTune-RCI](https://github.com/gptune/GPTune){:target="_blank"} implementations which enable parallel function evaluation during BO. My parallel BO implementations reduced search time by up to 84% for prominent HPC applications. Further testing also demonstrated up to 77% reduced search time relative to the state-the-art HPC tuner (DeepHyper) which also employs parallelism. Additionally, I implemented a novel parallel multitask learning algorithm which improves both time-to-optimal-solution and final solution quality. I am currently exploring other BO strategies and detailing our results in a paper.

### Improving the Scalability of Large Scale Image Processing through HPC 
#### Van Andel Institute | May 2023 - July 2023
Overseen by [Professor Brian Haab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mC3JPI8AAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}, I built a large scale image processing toolkit for biological sliding window analysis. By combining the integral image method with GPU programming, I achieved a speedup of 131,806x on small-scale images and a speedup of 10,901x on large-scale microscopy images compared to the previously used method. Our toolkit is publicly available through the [BioPII](https://github.com/OckermanSethGVSU/Bio-PII){:target="_blank"} PIP package. Our work was recently accepted as a short paper in IEEE CIBCB 2023.

### Predicting COVID-19 Cases Using Twitter Image Data
#### Grand Valley State University | July 2020 - Sep. 2022
Mentored by [Professor Erin Carrier](https://eecarrier.github.io/){:target="_blank"}, I created a project that helped to improve our COVID response through more accurate COVID-19 case count prediction. My work was published in [IEEE ICMLA 2022](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10068950){:target="_blank"}.

### Improving AI Model Selection in the Domain of Digital Agriculture
#### The Ohio State University | May 2022 - December 2022
Mentored by [Professor Christopher Stewart](https://cse.osu.edu/people/stewart.962){:target="_blank"}, I worked to examine the current neural network benchmarking practices in digital agriculture. I empirically demonstrated the dangers of using classical datasets for digital agriculture neural network benchmarking. Additionally, I designed a GBM which could predict final neural network test set performance  with 87% accuracy using only 3% of the training time required for convergence. I led a team of three in the writing of an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03315){:target="_blank"}, and later I built my work into a full paper which was accepted for publication at [AAAI 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vBSUoUuAYOA){:target="_blank"}.

### Improving the Accessibility of Video Games
#### Grand Valley State University | Sep. 2019 - June 2020 
My freshmen year, I worked as a research assistant for [Professor Ira Woodring](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ira-woodring-3720a47a){:target="_blank"}. I helped perform literature review, summarized and aggregated useful sources, and contributed towards a GameBoy Emulator in C.
