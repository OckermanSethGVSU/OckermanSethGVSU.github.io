My past research tended to involve the application of ML in a variety of areas such as systems, public health, and digital agriculture. I am hoping to focus in on systems and networking research during my Ph.D.

## Improving the Scalability of Large Scale Image Processing through HPC
Mentored by Professor Brian Haab, I am currently building a large scale image processing pipeline. As each single image is 9 million x 9 million pixels, I am building the pipeline to make use of GPU optimization through the CuBLAS package. If time allows, I plan to extend our implementation to enable multi-GPU and multi-node processing.

## Predicting COVID-19 Cases Using Twitter Image Data
Mentored by Professor Erin Carrier, I created a project that helped to improve our COVID response through more accurate COVID-19 case count prediction. My work was published in IEEE ICMLA 2022 (link to be included when available) where I recently presented it.

## Improving AI Model Selection in the Domain of Digital Agriculture
Mentored by Professor Christopher Stewart, I worked to examine the current neural network benchmarking practices in digital agriculture. I empirically demonstrated the dangers of using classical datasets for digital agriculture neural network benchmarking. Additionally, I designed a GBM which could predict final neural network test set performance  with 87% accuracy using only 3% of the training time required for convergence. I led a team of three in the writing of an [arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03315), and I built my work out into a [full paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vBSUoUuAYOA) which was accepted for publication at AAAI 2023. 

## Improving the Accessibility of Video Games
My freshmen year, I worked as a research assistant for Professor Ira Woodring. I helped perform literature review, summarized and aggregated useful sources, and contributed towards a GameBoy Emulator in C.
