In my free time, I am typically doing something active. In high school I was an avid cross country athlete, and over the last 3 years Iâ€™ve gotten into Crossfit. I enjoy going for nature hikes and (if it is warm enough) bringing along a hammock and a good book. I am also a passionate writer and reader who will geek out about C.S. Lewis if given the chance.

Fun fact about me, I have run a marathon as well as completed a 100 mile bike ride! I am debating trying triathlons to add some swimming into the mix :)
